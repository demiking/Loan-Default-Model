# Loan-Default-Model
This is a model built to detect loan defaulters. 
Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, as there are more loan repayments than defaulters, it had to be sampled. In this case, it was under sampled by using the RandomUnderSampler. This balanced the dataset before building the model.

The effect on the recall of the minor class can be seen.
